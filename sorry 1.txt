      <h1>My Dearest [Her Name],</h1>
      <p>I've been thinking a lot about everything that's happened, and I realize that no words can truly fix the hurt I’ve caused. But I hope this letter serves as a step toward showing you how deeply sorry I am, and how much you mean to me.</p>
      <p>Like the delicate petals of a flower, my love for you is soft, but it’s also strong, and it grows every day. I know that I’ve made mistakes, and I’ve caused you pain when I should have been there for you with nothing but care, respect, and love. Please believe me when I say that I never intended to hurt you—my heart aches knowing I’ve let you down.</p>
      <p>I want you to know that I am committed to doing better, to listening more, to understanding you in the ways you need me to. If I could take back my words or actions, I would, but I can’t. What I can do is show you, every single day, that I will never stop trying to make things right.</p>
      <p>I love you more than any apology can express, and I promise to work on being the partner you deserve. I hope we can heal from this, and together, grow stronger than ever—like a garden of beautiful flowers, renewed with time, patience, and care.</p>
      <p>You mean everything to me. I am truly sorry, and I will spend the rest of my days making it up to you.</p>
